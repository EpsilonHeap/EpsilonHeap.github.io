Research can broadly be classified into two 'Ying-Yang' categories of reinforcing components: exploration and explotation of knowledge or cognative abilities. Below is a list of topics covering the papers sitting on my desk. Although a small sample compared to those stored as bits on various devices, this list is representative of the results of 'exploration'. The organization and categorization is somewhat haphazard yet still revealing. A harder task is to distill this list into a research agenda.

  1. Simpson's paradox
  2. St. Petersburg paradox

  4. Two-Envelop paradox
  5. Arcsine law
+ Hard and Soft
  1. Generating functions
  2. Probability interpretation
