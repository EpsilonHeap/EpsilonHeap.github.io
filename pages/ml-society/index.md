# Contemplating the future of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

## Progress

Consider what a Machine Learning and Artificial Intellegence (ML/AI) fueled transformation of society might be like. Or perhaps what cornerstones would be required to make an acceptable transition to such a society -- acceptable in the sense that humans are integral.

The computer revolution propelled our world to a current standing that harkens a new kind of society. Data (by the way of communications networks) and computing are considered the new 'oil' \[see this [rebuttal](https://venturebeat.com/2019/02/10/data-is-not-the-new-oil/)\]
and 'electricty' that will enabled tremendous growth. Will this vision be realized? Recall that AI had previously [under-delivered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) in a earlier incarnations.

But first, let's put progress in perspective. Tyler Cowen's [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_93CXTt2K7c) suggests that innovation for society as a whole has stagnated. And in a telling set of lectures by Richard Hamming on advancements in science and technologies, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD4b-52jtos) clearly advocates that computers are the future. In both cases, computing is highlighted as a rare case where progress exceeded expectations! Will this wave of ML/AI follow a similar trajectory for be another case of hype over substance?

## Exceptional Advancements

Let's take some time to review how computing evolved so quickly.

Hardware and software, intermediate by the brilliance of human minds, were and still are in a tightly coupled, synergistic cycle of advancements. Faster hardware engendered more sophisticated software which beget even more powerful hardware and so on.

What are the reciprocating forces of ML/AI? Some might suggests that the aforementioned data-computing duo ... but that seems unlikely.
