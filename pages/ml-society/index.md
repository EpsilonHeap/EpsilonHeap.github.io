# Contemplating the future of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

## Progress

Consider what a Machine Learning and Artificial Intellegence (ML/AI) fueled transformation of society might be like. Or perhaps what cornerstones would be required to make an acceptable transition to such a society -- acceptable in the sense that humans are integral.

The computer revolution propelled our world to a current standing that harkens a new kind of society. Data (by the way of communications networks) and computing are considered the new 'oil' \[see this [rebuttal](https://venturebeat.com/2019/02/10/data-is-not-the-new-oil/)\]
and 'electricty' that will enabled tremendous growth. Will this vision be realized? Recall that AI had previously [under-delivered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) in a earlier incarnations.

But first, let's put progress in perspective. Tyler Cowen's [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_93CXTt2K7c) suggests that innovation for society as a whole has stagnated. And in a telling set of lectures by Richard Hamming on advancements in science and technologies, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD4b-52jtos) clearly advocates that computers are the future. In both cases, computing is highlighted as a rare case where progress exceeded expectations! Will this wave of ML/AI follow a similar trajectory for be another case of hype over substance? [Note: ML/AI has made tremendous progress. Although not at the level being touted by some.]

## Exceptional Advancements

Let's take some time to review how computing evolved so quickly.

Hardware and software, intermediate by the brilliance of human minds, were and still are in a tightly coupled, synergistic cycle of advancements. Faster hardware engendered more sophisticated software which beget even more powerful hardware and so on.

[Economics]

What are the reciprocating forces of ML/AI? Some might suggests that the aforementioned data-computing duo; however, that seems like a hard sell. As the rebuttal article linked above suggests, data gathering for the sake of human-computer common pattern baseline is advanced, and more of it offers a diminishing returns. The statistical character of Human languages, faces, pictures of cats, etc have been established, and these do not change rapidly nor significantly over time. Gathering more data for these established baselines will not likely yield great advances. Additional value-add would need to come from integration of data streams, specializing for a niche, new sources of data, or rapidly changing data. And of these, those that will yield stable statistical characterization will reach maturity and trend towards diminishing returns. The prospects of reinforcing growth from generation to generation is not so clear. Lets enumerate:

1. Integration (data-fusion) is more a problem of methodologies.
2. Specialization means gathering data for a specific use and is not meant to have broad catalytic effects. Perhaps massive specialization as a whole can turn the collective process into a growth driver.
3. New sources of data is unknowable. Maybe finer details (similar to weather prediction) would be enough. Another prospect leaves humans out of the loop - computers can generate data with no meaning for us amongst themselves.
4. Rapidly changing data seems like a good candidate ... except for the rapid part. Ephemeral patterns, unless a meta pattern emerges, would not be a good foundation for further advancements.

Let me be clear. Currently, data as examples of a desired (or undesirable) pattern is still highly valuable. Much resources is direct at this effort and rightly so; the game is still young. The questions is of sustainability of an 'age' as in 'industrial', 'iron', or 'computer'. Is more data a foundation for sustained advancements?

On the other hand, computing seem to a good foundational piece for the next generation. Then a conundrum seems to be at hand. Data sells for good money and is consider valuable (Facebook, Amazon, and likes are data-driven companies.) Yet computing power (clouds) is cheap, and algorithms (ML/AI frameworks) are given away. My guess is that this situation will likely turn. The current situation is a product of the 'ramping up' stage.

Recall that the thought experiment was regarding the prospects of exponential advancement in ML/AI over the a period comparable to the computer age. The intent was not to discount data or Data Science, which will continue to grow and flourish. But probably at a pace akin to automobiles or lasers - substantial yet less than explosive.

<!-- Ironically, besides computing, human brain power, does seem to be a key ingredient. Hence, the mad scramble for human capital with the right expertise seems appropriate. -->
