Pursuit of knowledge, research, art, companions, sports and any number of wonderful things are the best of what the human experience has to offer. One that is sometimes neglected is to invest for life. Financial freedom relieves many unpleasant problems and investing should be one of your pursuits

Managing wealth is a good problem to have, and the 'best' approach is in the eyes of the beholder. Moreover, objectives are subject to change over time; however, one fundamental rule is to stay financially 'alive'. Even in the worst of times, be sure that sufficient funds are available to rekindle the fire. 

A second rule that many would subscribe to is: never lose money. This is the main mantra of Warren Buffet's investment approach - which encompasses the first but is listed separately because, to various degrees, losing a fraction of capital is acceptable for the opportunity of sizable gains.

The underlying message is that wealth management should be taken seriously, and should not be done on a whim. Work diligently to ensure that loses were taken on a calculated wager.

In broad strokes, employing markets and economic activities to manage wealth can be brushed into three schemes:

1. Trading
2. Allocation
3. Long Term

Each is targeted at the various components of what constitutes a 'signal' of the accumulation of wealth, e.g. S&P 500 index. Trading is used to extract value from the minute fluctuations of markets on a short time-scale. If these movements corresponds to random 'noise', then extracting value is very difficult. Nevertheless, some have been able to find an 'edge' in such an environment. For instance, access to market participants, an informational advantage, or sheer speed from technical advances have all been successful used in building wealth.

An allocation approach targets the slower, collective movements of funds as markets chase opportunities and economic activities reflect societal dynamics. These occur on a longer time scale and typically play out over a few months or years. Examples are depression, recession, stagflation, growth, low or high interest rates, geo-political shifts, emerging economies, business cycles, and hype.

Recall that avoiding losses is the single most important investment rule independent of the investment style. Form a value perspective, preserving capital is paramount because compounding and time are your greatest allies, and you need stable capital to drive a value strategy.

The abilities to anticipate emerging trends and economic cycles, prepare contingencies, and act decisively (doubts and uncertainly are not so easy to overcome) are all needed to avoid losses and benefit from shifting sentiments. Note that not missing out on the upside is also very important - risk should not be avoided. Allocation probably forms the core of wealth management. Trading and long term strategies are akin to predicting very short and long term outcomes, and both are notoriously hard tasks. Whereas allocation is more dependent on sustained, astute, and objective observations, attention to details, organization, experience, and convection.

Long term strategies attempt to capture trends that end up as a fabric of our society for the foreseeable future. These are investments that are sustainable and hard to displaced - think electrical grids, cars, radio waves, electronics, lasers, computers, Internet, as wells as insurance, medicine, fast foods, airlines, and such. Here, the goals are to get in early; take advantage of mis-valuations or panic; spot reinforcing synergies or emerging trends; or taking chances with calculated and well-reasoned investments.

Luck plays a significant role in investing. People will argue on how much is luck versus skills, but very few will dismiss luck as having any sway. Good Luck!
