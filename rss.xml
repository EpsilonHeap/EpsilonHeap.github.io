&lt;p&gt;Educated as an Electrical engineer early in life and having more recently worked as a 'quant' for many years,the topic of time series analysis has evolved from a clean one to a bewildering hodgepodge of complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some fundamental issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transactional - data from markets are records of transactional events and not uniformly sampled; therefore, times series are non-homogeneous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stationarity - market data are not necessarily stationary and often have complicated time-delayed feedback structures. Moreover, change points (or regime shifts) are not uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ergodicity - practitioners often analyze time series to aid in prediction; but under what condition can the histories of (single realizations of)sampled paths be considered representative of future behavior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other issues like low signal-to-noise, high dimensionality, missing values, and outliers. Although these are important, the three highlighted undermine the applicability of traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transactional&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally an engineer dealing with signals mainly work with Fourier transforms and related objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat f(\xi) e^{2 \pi i \xi x} d\xi 
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean and elegant. This formalism is fundamental and will not likely ever diminish in stature. Yet quantitative-minded participants in finance, in particular currency traders of the late 1990's, pointed out a significant characteristics of the data of their trade that needed addressing:
&lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=208278"&gt;Operators on Inhomogeneous Time Series&lt;/a&gt;. A central idea underlying inhomogeneous time series is that 'time' is proportional to the density of 'activity'. With regards to the 'information' content of inhomogeneous market data, this paper &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1989555"&gt;'Discerning Information from Trade Data'&lt;/a&gt; describes a aggregated 'tick' or 'bar' approach - essentially integrating pieces of data partitioned by time into informational units for analysis. Aside: a good presentation of the many pitfalls encountered by financial professionals are in Marcos Lopez de Prado's &lt;a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Advances+in+Financial+Machine+Learning-p-9781119482109"&gt;'Advances in Financial Machine Learning'&lt;/a&gt;. A Jupyter notebook in the blog post &lt;a href="http://www.blackarbs.com/blog/exploring-alternative-price-bars"&gt;'Exploring Alternative Price Bars'&lt;/a&gt; illustrates this approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://example.com/posts/Time%20series/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2019 19:34:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>first tiny bit</title><link>https://example.com/posts/first-tiny-bit/</link><dc:creator>Your Name</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Trying out different site generators.
