<h2>Manufacturing Innovation?</h2>
<p>That rarest product of intellectual activities, original innovation, is often serendipitous. Many organizations are well aware of the elusive nature of innovation and yet persists in the pursuit of research and development (jokingly depicted as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=1ttmXOaMMuKGggfI9oyYCw&amp;q=far+side+cat+herding+cartoons&amp;oq=far+side+cat+herding+cartoons&amp;gs_l=img.3...0.0..27395...0.0..0.0.0.......1......gws-wiz-img.HTpJM9I9_yk">herding cats</a>) in hopes of finding 'the next big thing'. One approach that has demonstrated success is to cultivate a certain culture and attract individuals with specific characteristics to foster a 'breeding' ground for creative risk-taking. Noted omissions are the mention of 'experience', 'skill-set', or knowledge of specific technologies or academic subjects: a deliberate choice. The intended differentiation is to separate products of intellectual activities or processes from the factors that drive innovation. Again, the emphasis is not refinement nor incremental improvements but finding something 'new'. Find people that will find a way forward, even (or especially) if they don't know what they are doing.</p>
<h2>"Taste"</h2>
<p>Two examples of organizations that have engineered innovation on a large-scale are Bell Labs and Xerox. There are others but these two seem particularly influential. One common theme shared by the two is the rather nebulous word "taste".</p>
<p><a href="http://www.johnseelybrown.com/">John Seely Brown</a> (JSB) ran Xerox's research organization during my time there. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amdONcqQvnU">Here</a> is a fun and informative video of his take on research at Xerox. JSB uses a triad of aspiration, imagination, and intuition as pillars supporting his concept of 'taste'. The culture that he described was real and clearly evident in how research managers operated - <a href="https://www.xerox.com/en-us/about/executive-leadership/corporate-officers/steve-hoover-biography">Steve Hoover</a>, now CTO at Xerox, expounded these same core ideas when our discussions turned to how research was done at Xerox.
JSB's description of the preference for 'edge' workers and the importance of 'taste' is traditional and was passed down from the days of <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/04/youve-never-heard-tech-legend-bob-taylor-invented-almost-everything/">Robert Taylor</a>.</p>
<p>Yet another legendary organization was Bell Labs. <a href="https://history.computer.org/pioneers/hamming.html">Richard Hamming</a> was in the thick of things there and gave a personalized set of lectures (which starts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD4b-52jtos">here</a>) on being successful in intellectual pursuits.  He also mentioned 'taste' as being vital to channeling efforts into good work.</p>
<h2>From Elusive to Vague</h2>
<p>So ... an elusive goal (innovation) could very well be the product of some vague notion (taste), amongst other things. Not helpful. Then let's see what other thinking are not helpful?</p>
<p>An over reliance on pure technical abilities or specific knowledge as indicative of likely success. Science and technologies are evolving fast and paying heed to <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/05/04/adapt/">Darwin</a> may be good advice: adaptability should be a prized trait. From a cognitive perspective, adaptability is a manifestation of curiosity, imagination, discipline, and astuteness. Advice: spend your resources on finding individuals with these characteristics, not those who do well on coding challenges or did well in school (remember the stated goal is innovation.) A slide in JSB's talk clearly said: 'Never looked at a transcript'.</p>
<p>To wit: Tensorflow, in a short time-span, will have changed from one execution model (see <a href="https://medium.com/tensorflow/whats-coming-in-tensorflow-2-0-d3663832e9b8">medium article</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9ysmtn/d_debate_on_tensorflow_20_api/">reddit discussion</a>) to another, and users will have to essentially learn a new system. Yes, just one example, but this is not an isolated case. Technology may be fleeting, fundamentals have a much longer self-life.</p>
<p>Another would be 'high energy' disguised as motivation. Many people are motivated but not self-directed, and you need both. A self-directed individual needs guidance but not much management. Be careful to see aspiration in a clear light.</p>
<p>Lastly, do not dismiss but make room for intuition. This is one of those terms that are hard to define but not too difficult to recognize. Not too difficult because this trait is often expressed as a 'magical' ability to formulate solutions or ask the right questions. Ask hard, open-ended questions and observe what ensues. The answer doesn't have to be right, just penetrating or meandering towards plausible reasoning. Questions like those on an academic test (or puzzles if just a matter of memorization) that elicit some expected answers seldom highlight intuition.</p>
