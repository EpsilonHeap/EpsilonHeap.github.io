# What!?

This one falls under the 'mind-bending' category that has initiated a personal re-examination of the whole practice of regression. Bertsimas and Van Parys released ['Sparse High-Dimensional Regression: Exact Scalable Algorithms and Phase Transitions'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10029) upon the world and shook my foundations. [Professor Bertsimas's](http://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/) [Hotelling lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w9aRrYgGEs) is a good video presentation of his approach to the topic.
\[Note: Optimization is a foundational showcase of the power of computing - pay attention to this field.\]

An earlier paper ['Best Subset Selection via a Modern Optimization Lens'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03133) started the buzz and elicited Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Ryan Tibshirani to respond with ['Extended Comparisons of Best Subset Selection, Forward Stepwise Selection, and the Lasso'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08692).
